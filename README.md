# Upskillcampus

Project Name: Crop and Weed Detection Using Machine Learning 

Project Description  
This project leverages machine learning to distinguish between crops and weeds using image data. It enhances precision agriculture by automating weed detection, minimizing manual labor, and optimizing crop yield.  

Features

âœ” Detects and classifies crops and weeds from images.  
âœ” Utilizes a pre-trained ML model for accurate classification.  
âœ” Runs seamlessly in Jupyter Notebook within VS Code.  
âœ” Generates visual outputs for better analysis.  

Tech Stack 
Programming Language:Python  
Libraries Used: 
- Jupyter Notebook  
- TensorFlow/Keras  
- OpenCV  
- Scikit-learn  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

3. Extract the dataset inside the project folder.  

Example dataset structure:  
```
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train  
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ crop  
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ weed  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test  
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ crop  
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ weed  
```

Model Training 
To train the model inside Jupyter Notebook, run:  
```python
from train import train_model  # Example function in train.py
train_model(epochs=50, batch_size=32)
```
